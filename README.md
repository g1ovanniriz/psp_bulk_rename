# psp_bulk_rename
Rename multiple psp games to EBOOT.PBP, every file in its folder, automatically

To use it, run the script and copy your game PBP files in the created PBP_FILES folder.
This will create a folder with your gaame name and the EBOOT.PBP in that folder

EXAMPLE:
Run the script
Copy "Need For Speed.pbp" into "PBP_FILES"
Press enter on the script window
"PBP_FILES/Need for Speed.pbp" will become "PBP_FILES/Need for Speed/EBOOT.PBP"
And you can copy your games to your psp "PSP/GAMES" folder
 (MULTIPLE GAMES CAN BE CONVERTED AT ONCE, JUST COPY ALL YOUR GAMES IN PBP_FILES)

NOTE: If you put other files that aren't psp game files they will be renamed to EBOOT.PBP anyways
